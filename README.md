Visually impaired individuals often face challenges when it comes to navigating and understanding their surroundings. To help overcome this, our project aims to create a comprehensive, AI-powered tool with the following key features:

🔍 Real-time Scene Interpretation – Generate detailed descriptions of the surroundings based on the uploaded image.
📝 Text Extraction – Extract and interpret any text present in images using Optical Character Recognition (OCR).
🚧 Object & Obstacle Recognition – Detect objects and obstacles within images, providing essential insights.
🔊 Text-to-Speech Conversion – Convert extracted text to speech for enhanced accessibility.
